-Finalized buget cuts
--Less expensive motors

-Do we need the micro controller?
--Arm can be run using radio waves and DC gear motors
---Micro controllers are bulky to be added o the copter, and a bit overpowered
---No micro controller simplifies design
--Microcontrollers can be used to enforce bounds
---No burning out motors
---Enforce arm length
---Can also work LED control

-Final decisions
--Keep micro-controller
--Battery charger can be borrowed

-Funding
--Elliot and Kora went to find the woman in charge of funding, were told to come back later
--Hess needed for advice on motors

Priorities:
	Possibly get a group picture for Snapshot day?
