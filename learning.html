        <h3 class="title">Background</h3>
           <p>
            The University of Idaho College of Natural Resources (CNR)  does extensive research into various types of trees
            throughout Idaho state. However, in order to conduct some areas of study, students must gather hard-to-access
            materials for research. Some of these materials include samples of "sun foliage." This term constitutes the upper-most 
            branches of a tree which have the most exposure to sunlight. Because of this exposure, they are the most optimal 
            specimens to use in researching the tree itself. Currently, there are three common methods used to extract this type 
            of foliage: 
           <ol>
              <li> Transported Crane - The most expensive current method involves transporting a crane onto the scene with the 
                                     desired trees. Using a crane means that the sun-foliage of even the highest trees is usually
                                     easily accessible. However, this involves renting and transporting a crane, as well as
                                     hiring a crane operator to help with sample gathering. It also limits the amount of trees 
                                     that are easily accessible, as the body of the crane must be moved whenever a tree is out of reach.
                                     Thus, while it may be useful in a small clearing, where one can easily reach various different 
                                     trees, it is not as efficient in a remote, tightly forested area.</li> 
              <li> Tree Climbers -     This method involves individuals climbing the trees to the very top where individual samples 
                                     will be collected. With the proper safety training and harnesses, this can be a very fruitful
                                     method. The time required to ascend and descend each individual tree is extensive, though, meaning 
                                     that it may take an inordinate amount of time to gather a respectable amount of samples. It
                                     also involves risking the individual climber, as the samples are often collected directly before 
                                     the dawn hours when sight may be limited. </li>
              <li> Shotgun -           Using a shot gun is the most common method employed by the University of Idaho in collecting
                                     sun foliage. It envolves an individual standing at the base of the tree and shooting upwards,
                                     aiming at the particular branch desired. This method is relatively inexpensive, and only requires
                                     one collector in the field. It is not the most efficient collection method, however, as it usually 
                                     involves multiple shots with even the most skilled individual. Even when the branch is finally cut
                                     by the bullet, it is not guaranteed that it will fall to where the researcher can collect it. </li>
           </ol>
          </p>
           <p>
           </p>
        <h3 class="title">Goal</h3>
          <p>
            The project goal is to produce a fully working prototype by the end of Fall 2013. This prototype
            will be able to fly and reliably cut the uppermost branches of the trees researched by the CNR 
            department. 
          </p>
           <p>
           </p>
        <h3 class="title">Team Makeup and General Planning</h3>
          <p>
            The team will include six students, from electrical engineering, computer engineering, and computer science.
            Hardware development will include ordering the proper materials in order to construct a portable quadcopter,
            and the lattice arm attachment that will contain the clippers to gather the top-most branches of trees. 
            Software wise, microgrid controllers will be programmed to lower and raise the arm, close and open the
            clippers, and control the direction of the quadcopter's flight. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The first semester of this project included six students. These students represented the electrical engineering, 
            computer engineering, and computer science departments from the University of Idaho. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In the course of developing the hardware for this project, the team decided that power, visibility, and accuracy
            would be the most important design features for the F.E.T.C.H. product. Power is necessary in order to provide the
            force necessary for the quad copter to fly. Visibility is required in order to ensure device safety. Accuracy must be high
            in order to prove that the quad copter to more effective than current methods. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The process of hardware development has included putting together and ordering a list of needed materials. These materials
            were chosen for their physical and computational power, so that they might better contribute to the strength of the design. 
            The materials have been ordered are on route to the University of Idaho, where they will be assembled into the quad-copter
            and its lattice-work arm attachment.
          </p>
          <p> 
            For software, the final product will include both a flight controller and fully programmed microcontroller. The flight controller 
            has been pre-programmed to help the operator correct for balance in higher altitudes, and also includes a GPS for easy 
            location. The microcontroller will control the lattice-work arm and it's cutting implement. Currently, the flight controller is
            in transit with other quad-copter hardware. The microcontroller has been programmed to light the quad copter LEDs with push-button
            control, and control DC motor movement with RC controller signals.
