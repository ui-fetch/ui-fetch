          <h3 class="title">The Flying Device</h3>
          <div class="entry">
            <ul>
              <li>Helicopter - For weight management and power conservation
                               the team originally considered using a simple
                               helicopter design. However, high altitudes, 
                               wind conditions, and payload weight might
                               upset the balance of the single propellor.
              </li>
              <li>Quadcopter - The strength of the quadcopter lies in its
                                cross design, which provides a central point 
                                of strength in the middle. With four propellors,
                                it also is easier to maintain balance in flight. 
              </li>
              <li>Octocopter - Octo-copters are also well balanced, as there 
                                are many propellors to correct any problems during
                                flight. They are also generally heavier than other flight device,
                                due to the added motors. They are also more expensive. 
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h3 class="title">The Arm</h3>
          <div class="entry">
            <ul>
              <li>Hinge extension - This would involve the arm being a single length 
                                    that was lowered from a hinge joint on the flight device 
                                    This is a simple, efficient design, that 
                                    can be very light weight. It is also fragile, 
                                    and has the possibility of throwing off the balance
                                    of the flight device during extension.
              </li>
              <li>Telescoping extension - Using this method, the arm would consist of 
                                          layers of tubing nested within one another,
                                          which extended in a manner similar to a telescope.
                                          This is a lightweight mechanism, but also fragile and 
                                          complicated.
              </li>
              <li>Lattice work - This mechanism consists of a latticework arm framework, 
                                 controlled by a gear rack. As this gear rack decremented or
                                 incremented, the ends of the framwork would contract or expand,
                                 with would in turn retract or extend the arm. This design is 
                                 heavier, but also more sturdy. It also provides easy length variability. 
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            <ul>
              <li>
                  Extend from side - The idea behind this design would be that the arm would 
                                     extend to one side of the flight device, which would in turn fly
                                     next to a tree. This is easy to understand, but will likely
                                     be detrimental to the flight device balance.
                                     <br/><img src="images/armtake1.jpg"/>

              </li>
              <li>
                  Extend from bottom, then side - To correct for the possible weight imbalance, and
                                                  provide more distance between propellors 
                                                  and tree limbs, this design would drop below the flight device. 
                                                  Once it had extended a certain amount, it would then reach
                                                  out sideways towards the tree. This is a more functional design,
                                                  but there exists a problem in different branch angles. 
                                                  <br/><img src="images/armtake2.jpg"/>

              </li>
              <li>Extend straight down - This design would optimize both balance and branch-cutting angle. 
                                         By extending straight down from the flying device, it could easily 
                                         cut branches. However, if the flight device looses control, 
                                         the arm will be more likely to hit the tree it is 
                                         sampling. In this case, it will probably break.
                                         <br/><img src="images/armtake3.jpg"/>

            </ul>
          </div>

          <h3 class="title">The Cutting Attachment</h3>
          <div class="entry">
            <ul>
              <li>Saw - This method would see the use of a small saw in detaching
                        sun foliage branches from the tree. Miniature saws provide
                        quick cutting motion, and are easy to replace if damaged.
                        On the other hand, the teeth of the saw might get caught 
                        in the branch and upset the balance of the flight device.
                        <br/><img src="images/saw.jpg"/>

              </li>
              <li>Shears - Using shears would require them to be mounted at the end
                           of the arm attachment, and operated using the force of some separate 
                           mechanism. This provides a steady cutting force, provided that the
                           shears are sharp. There is also the possibility of being able 
                           to maintain grip of the sample branch. There is the opportunity for
                           rusting, though, and shears are far heavier than saws.

               In the final design concept, a quadcopter was chosen. Functionally, this is because 
               a quadcopter provides the most balance with the least amount of weight. Economically,
               it is also the most affordable, stable structure that Team FETCH can afford.

          <div class="entry">
            <p>
               A lattice-work arm extending straight below the quadcopter was decided on. Though it 
               is slightly heavier than other design possibilities, it is also the least fragile and 
               easiest to fix. Extending straight down will also give the propellors a wide berth in their
               operation, which is a good safety feature for the quadcopter hardware.

            <p>
               Shears, specifically cut-and-hold pruners, were the chosen solution for collecting branch samples. 
               This is because they provide a steady, easily controlled cutting motion that saw blades cannot quite
               achieve. Cut-and-hold shears also come with an added plastic attachment that provides the operator with 
               the ability to maintain their grip on the branch samples for easy collection.
